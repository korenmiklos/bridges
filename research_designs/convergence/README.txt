`count_left_right_post_offices.py` counts the number of post offices in each decade within the 10km radius of each bridge, separately for left- and right bank.

`convergence.do` runs event study regressions. small_share is the share of the smallest side (left or right), hence always smaller than 50%. With convergence, we expect this to go up _after_ the bridges is built.
