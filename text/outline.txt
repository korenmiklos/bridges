A model of bridges
	Outline
	Trade model
	Spatial equilibrium
	Comparative statics
Empirical content
	Key statements
		1. Bridges reduce trade costs substantially
		2. They affect pairs of points differentially (morph space)
		3. People agglomerate to minimize trade costs
	Alternative hypotheses
		People agglomerate for other reasons, and build bridges nearby
Research designs
	Cross-sectional correlations
		Density is higher at river
		Density is higher at bridge
	Bridges or agglomeration?
		Tappan Zee Bridge
		Hazard of bridges
			There is no more than random clustering of bridges
		Event study
			Bridge regions grow faster
		Bresnahan-Reiss?
	Morphing of space
		Clustering at rivers
		Convergence
			Two sides of river converges _after_ bridge is built
Broader implications
	Benefits of bridges
		External effects of transport infrastructure
		Delaware calibration
	The curse of landlocked countries
Future work
	Instrumenting bridges
