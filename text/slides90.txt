== The Upper Black Eddy Bridge on the Delaware River ==
\textquotedblleft \lbrack T]his new crossing brought additional business to
this part of the river valley. [...] By 1844, business in the now growing
town of Milford included three stores, three taverns, twelve to fiteen
mechanics' shops, a flour mill, and two new sawmills [...] Upper Black Eddy
on the Pennsylvania side of the river directly opposite Milford was a
favorite stop for timber raftsmen in the early days. By the mid-nineteenth
century the bridge brought even more business. Upper Black Eddy was booming,
too. It had forty houses, three hotels, and several stores and
shops.\textquotedblright \bigskip \newline

== Introduction ==
* People agglomerate in space to minimize trade costs (broadly defined).
* Being close to ''one another'' does not explain
	* ''where'' people locate 
	* ''magnitude'' of agglomeration.
...
* We show that the topology of space matters for agglomeration forces.
* Bridges, in particular, make market access more uneven, hence leading to strong agglomeration.

== What we do ==
* We build a theory to explain where people agglomerate in space.
* Stylized but geographically rich environment: a subset of the globe, divided by a river.
	* Trade costly, both inland and across the river.
	* Crossing the river over a bridge is less costly than crossing it by boat.
* Building a bridge decreases the cost of crossing the river at a point $\to$ increases concentration of economic activity around that point $\to$ brings about benefits from agglomeration.


== Results ==
* Model delivers a set of predictions on the spatial distribution of population around rivers and bridges.
	* Test predictions on high-resolution population data from the U.S.
* Conduct two additional exercises:
	* use historical data to check the effect of bridges on population growth,
	* estimate the causal effects of bridges with instrumental variables.

== Our contributions ==

* We use high-resolution historical data to test our theory.

4. Research designs
6. Conclusion




= A spatial model with bridges =
==	Outline ==
* We build a model of bridges at fixed locations, and analyze the resulting distribution of economic activity in space.
* Costly trade: location matters.
* Free labor mobility: people move to minimize trade costs.

== Geography ==
* Continuous space. Two regions, $R\in \left \{ H,F\right \} $,
separated by a river without meanders.
* A location is indexed by 
\[
z = \underset{\text{region}}{\underbrace{R}},\underset{\text{distance from river}}{\underbrace{\ell }},\underset{\text{closest river mile}}{\underbrace{h}}, 
\]
and is endowed with land $\lambda \left(z\right) >0$.
* Bridges at river miles $h_{1},\ldots ,h_{B}$.

== ==
\longfigure{figurem1}{Geography in our model}

== Trade costs ==
Shipment of goods is costly:
* land shipping over distance $d$ involves iceberg cost $e^{t_{i}d}$,
* crossing river by boat costs $e^{\tau _{i}^{0}}$,
* crossing river over bridge $b$ costs $e^{\tau _{i}^{b}}<e^{\tau_{i}^{0}}$.

== Consumption ==
* Mass of $N$ consumers, freely mobile across space.
* They value goods produced at each location (Armington): gravity equation of trade.
* Consumer living at $z$ owns local land, supplies one unit of labor inelastically, and chooses her consumption by maximizing
\begin{equation*}
u\left(z\right) = \int_{z'} q_{z'}\left(z \right)^{1-1/\sigma}dz.
\end{equation*}
* Utility-based price index
\begin{equation*}
P\left(z\right) = \int_{z'} [p_{z'}\tau(z',z)]^{1-1/\sigma}dz,
\end{equation*}
where $\tau(z',z)$ is the minimum transportation cost between $z'$ and $z$.

== Production ==
* Good $z$ produced by perfectly competitive firms combining labor and land under Cobb--Douglas production technology:
\begin{equation*}
	\underbrace{q\left(z\right)}_\text{output per unit of land}
	=
	\left[ \underbrace{\overline{a}\left(z\right)}_\text{unit cost of production}\right] ^{-1}
\cdot \left. \underbrace{n\left(z\right) }_\text{labor per unit of land}\right. ^{1-\alpha }
\end{equation*}

== Equilibrium ==
An equilibrium is a set of functions $p(z)$, $P(z)$, $n(z)$, $w(z)$ and $r$, such that
1. Utility of workers is maximized and equalized across locations.
2. Profits are maximized and driven down to zero.
3. Local land markets clear.
4. Local and global labor markets clear.
5. There is no arbitrage possibility within countries.
6. There is no arbitrage possibility over the river.
7. There is no arbitrage possibility over bridges.
8. Trade is balanced between each pair of locations.

= Space warping =
== How do bridges warp space? ==
To illustrate how bridges contribute to spatial heterogeneity, we explore a simple example step by step. How does a bridge change
1. bilateral and multilateral distances?
2. market access---as a direct result?
3. market access---due to labor mobility?

== ==
\longfigure{map_random}{Cities around a bridge (1)}
\longfigure{acrossriver_random}{Bilateral distance becomes more skewed after bridge}
\longfigure{change_random}{Winners were already close before the bridge\\
\small Market access becomes more uneven}
\longfigure{map_linedancers7}{Cities around a bridge (2)}
\longfigure{lines_bridgeandnarrow}{Bridges lead to more clustering than a comparable decline in river crossing costs}
\longfigure{rounds_bridge}{Labor mobility improves bridge location even further}

== Summary ==
1. Bridges make market access more skewed in space.
2. Labor mobility reinforces this skewness.
3. This effect may be quantitatively important for spatial agglomeration patterns.
...
* Especially in early times, when alternative was a ford or a ferry, which was slow and dangerous and when inland transportation was costly.
	* We need high-resolution historical data.




= Data =
== Data ==
* We use data on 12 major rivers in the continental U.S.
* We need precise geospatial data on
	* rivers,
	* (historical) bridges,
	* (historical) population.

== Rivers ==
* River geocoordinates from ESRI Map of U.S. Major Waters for Arkansas, Colorado, Columbia,
Connecticut, Delaware, Hudson, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Red River,
Snake\ River, Tennessee.
* We use the centerline of the river and index it by river miles.

== Bridges ==
* Bridge data is from bridgehunter.com, cross-referenced with Wikipedia, National Bridge Inventory, historical sources.
* For each bridge, we know:
	* river over which it passes
	* geocoordinates
	* year of building
	* year of decommissioning (if any)
	* other characteristics: rail, highway, structure, span
* For the Hudson, we include the tunnels at Manhattan.

== Population ==
* Current (1995) population come from Version 1 of the Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project population grid. 
	* Grid cells are $30\times 30$ arc seconds ($\approx 0.5\times 0.5$ km).
* Historical data from History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE).
	* Grid cells are $5\times 5$ arc minutes ($\approx 5\times 5$ km).
* Post offices to proxy for settlements.

== Using post offices to proxy for population ==
* We have data on opening dates of post offices (postalhistory.com).
* Before Rural Free Delivery began (1896--1903), mail was only delivered to post offices. Peoople needed a post office to pick up their mail.
	* Precise starting dates.
	* Smaller townships (one office for about every 2,000 people).
	* Precise geocoordinates (geocoded via geonames.usgs.gov).

= Research designs =
== Research designs ==
* We have a number of research designs that address:
	1. simple equilibrium correlations from the model
	2. two-way link between bridges and agglomeration
	3. space warping

==	Cross-sectional correlations ==
1. Density is higher at river.
2. Density is higher at bridge.


== ==
\widefigure{density-at-rivers}{More people live close to the river}
\widefigure{clustering-at-bridges}{More people live close to the bridge}



==	Which came first: bridges or agglomeration? ==
1. Event study
	* Bridge regions grow faster.
2. Instrumenting for bridges
	* Places with ``exogenous" bridges have more post offices.

== Event study ==
* Using historical post office data, compare bridge neighborhoods before and after the bridge was built.
	* Also works with (lower-resolution) population data from HYDE.
* Proxy for population density: number of post offices within 10km of the bridge.

== Estimable equation ==
Number of post offices within 10km of bridge $b$ on river $r$ in year $t=1890, ..., 1950$
\[
E ({N_{rbt}})
		 = \exp
		 \left[\mu_{rt}+\sum_{s=-40}^{40}\beta_s I(t=T_b+s) + \gamma_r m_{b}\right].
\]
* Trends may diverge across rivers ($\mu_{rt}$).
* Sea proximity increases population ($\gamma<0$), but differentially across rivers ($\gamma_r$).
* $\beta_s$ compares post office count at year $s$ since the bridge was built to other bridge locations in the same year on the same river.
* Estimate by Poisson regression.

== ==
\widefigure{pooled_event_study}{Post office count before and after the bridge}

== Event study results ==
* Post offices increase by 14 percent 40 years after the bridge ($F=45.69$).


== Instrumenting bridges ==
* Local demand for bridges may be correlated with subsequent development.
* Challenge: we need a high-resolution instrument that is uncorrelated with local agglomeration demand.
* Candidates:
	* local variation in bridge building costs (hydrology, geology) (see Tompsett, 2013)
	* transit demand for bridge:
		``The crossing at Easton was referred to as the New York--Harrisburg Crossing, indicating that the ferry here served travellers going to western Pennsylvania, and beyond. The two most frequently used river crossings for this traffic were at Trenton and Easton, and these crossings were where the first bridges over the Delaware were built." (p. 2 of Dale)
	* structural approach (e.g. bridges are likely 10-20 miles from another bridge)

== ==
\widefigure{columbia}{Delaunay triangles connecting old post offices}

== Transit demand for crossing ==
* Use post office locations 20 years prior to first bridge.
* Exclude post offices within 20km of river.
* Connect them with Delaunay triangles.
* Count predicted crossing points in each segment.

==	Warping of space ==
1. Clustering at rivers

	* Two sides of river converges in population levels ''after'' bridge is built

== ==
\widefigure{clustering-at-bridges}{Population is clustered more at the river}

== Two sides of the river converge after a bridge ==
* Suppose population is split unevenly on the two sides of the river at a given location.
* After the bridge, market access becomes similar on the two sides.
* Populations converge.

== Estimable equation ==
* Suppose left-bank is less populous before the bridge. Let 
\[
s_{rbt}^L = \frac{N_{rbt}^L}{N_{rbt}^L+N_{rbt}^R}
\]
denote the share of the smaller side.
* $H$: $s_{rbt}$ increases (towards 50\%) after the bridge.
\[
s_{rbt}		 = 
 	\mu_{rt}+\sum_{s=-40}^{40}\beta_s I(t=T_b+s) + e_{rbt}.
\]

== Convergence results ==
* Significant convergence for Columbia, Delaware, Ohio, Missouri..., Mississippi, Snake River,   
* not for Arkansas, Colorado, Hudson, Connecticut, Red River, Tennessee. 
* Pooled results: share of smaller side increases from 24 to 30 percent ($F=14.89$).



= Broader implications =
== Broader implications ==
With agglomeration externalities (not currently modeled) our theory would predict
1. high returns to pointlike transport infrastructure
2. additional gains from trade

==	Benefits of bridges ==
1. External effects of transport infrastructure
	* Akerman (2009): Öresund Bridge increased industry productivity in Malmö via Melitz-type selection.
2. Delaware calibration
	* We calibrate the model to the 19th century Delaware river and estimate:
		* 4 percent welfare gain from first bridge
		* 15 percent total gain from first 21 bridges

==	The curse of landlocked countries ==
* Landlocked countries perform much worse than coastal countries.
* Standard estimates of gains from trade are way too low to explain this.
* Potential explanation: opening ports and other trading posts has agglomeration benefits.



= Conclusion =
== Conclusion ==
* 2D model of location and trade.
* Spatial pattern of population around bridges is consistent with the model.
* Bridge regions grow faster.
* Two sides of river converge in size after bridge is built.
* Potentially large welfare gains from early bridges.
