== Introduction ==
* People agglomerate in space to minimize trade costs (broadly defined).
* Being close to ''one another'' does not explain
	* ''where'' people locate 
	* ''magnitude'' of agglomeration.
...
* We show that the topology of space and transport infrastructure matters for agglomeration forces.
* Bridges, in particular, reduce trade costs in a particular point, hence leading to strong agglomeration.

== Spatial inequality ==
* Holmes and Lee (2010): 46 percent of people live on 1.7 percent of the populated area of the U.S.
* Within the average MSA, 50 percent of people live on 10 percent of the area.

== The Upper Black Eddy Bridge on the Delaware River ==
\textquotedblleft \lbrack T]his new crossing brought additional business to
this part of the river valley. [...] By 1844, business in the now growing
town of Milford included three stores, three taverns, twelve to fiteen
mechanics' shops, a flour mill, and two new sawmills [...] Upper Black Eddy
on the Pennsylvania side of the river directly opposite Milford was a
favorite stop for timber raftsmen in the early days. By the mid-nineteenth
century the bridge brought even more business. Upper Black Eddy was booming,
too. It had forty houses, three hotels, and several stores and
shops.\textquotedblright \bigskip \newline
(Dale, F.:\ Bridges over the Delaware river. A history of crossings)

== What we do ==
* We build a theory to explain where people agglomerate in space.
* Stylized geography: two side of a river.
	* Trade costly, both inland and across the river.
	* Crossing the river over a bridge is less costly than crossing it by boat.
* Building a bridge decreases the cost of crossing the river at a point, increasing concentration of economic activity around that point.


== Results ==
=== Theory ===
1. Closed form solutions for a stylized river geometry.
2. Bridges increase population density in their neighborhood.
3. Bridges increase spatial inequality, especially in their neighborhood.
4. The effect of bridges is magnified by trade and labor mobility.

=== Measurement ===
1. Build a dataset of 19th century US bridges on 12 major rivers. 
2. Event study shows that bridge areas grow faster ''after'' the bridge.
3. Estimate the causal effects of bridges with instrumental variables.

== Outline ==
1. A spatial model with bridges
3. Data on rivers and bridges
4. Preliminary empirical analysis
6. Conclusion




= A spatial model with bridges =
==	Outline ==
* We build a model of bridges at fixed locations, and analyze the resulting distribution of economic activity in space.
* Costly trade: location matters.
* Free labor mobility: people move to minimize trade costs.

== Geography: A tale of two banks ==
* We focus on just the two banks of the river.
* Many of our results hold for a 2D plain. But:
	* There may be other mechanisms why people move ''towards'' the river.
	* We have closed form solutions for the distribution of population.
* Two banks, $L$ and $R$. River is bounded between $[-k,k]$.
	* Location is indexed by bank and rivermile, $S=\{L,R\}\times [-k,k]$.
* We study the effect of a bridge at $0$.

== ==
\widefigure{topography}{Two riverbanks with a bridge}


== Trade costs ==
Shipment of goods is costly:
* land shipping over distance $d$ involves iceberg cost $e^{td}$,
* crossing river by boat costs $e^{\tau^{0}}$,
* crossing river over bridge $b$ costs $e^{\tau^{b}}<e^{\tau^{0}}$.

== Consumption ==
* Mass of $N$ consumers, freely mobile across space.
* They value goods produced at each location (Armington): gravity equation of trade.
* Representative consumer living at location $r \in S$ has utility function
\[
u \left( r \right) = \left[ \int_{S} x_{s} \left( r \right)^{1-1/\sigma} ds \right]^{\sigma/(\sigma-1)} N \left( r \right)^{-\lambda}
\]
	* $N^{-\lambda}$: congestion externality ensuring dispersion, $\lambda\ge0$
* Indirect utility:
\[
u \left( r \right) = \frac{w \left( r \right)}{P \left( r \right)} N \left( r \right)^{-\lambda}
\]
where $w \left( r \right)$ is the wage at location $r$, and $P \left( r \right)$ is the CES price index.

== Production ==
* Good $s$ produced by perfectly competitive firms using only labor:
\[
X(s) = N(s).
\]
* Factory-gate price equals unit cost
\[
p(s) = w(s)
\]

== Location choice ==
* Price index at location $r$,
\begin{equation*}
P\left(r\right) = \left[\int_{s} [p({s})\tau(s,r)]^{1-\sigma}dz\right]^{1/(1-\sigma)},
\end{equation*}
where $\tau(s,r)$ is the minimum transportation cost between $s$ and $r$.
	* We are interested in how bridges change $\tau(s,r)$.
* Consumers mobility equalizes real wages across locations
\[
P \left( r \right) = \bar{u}^{-1} w \left( r \right) N \left( r \right)^{-\lambda}.
\]


== Equilibrium ==
An equilibrium is a set of functions $p(z)$, $P(z)$, $n(z)$, and $w(z)$, such that
1. Utility of workers is maximized and equalized across locations.
2. Profits are maximized and driven down to zero.
4. Local labor markets clear.
5. There is no arbitrage possibility within countries.
6. There is no arbitrage possibility over the river.
7. There is no arbitrage possibility over bridges.
8. Trade is balanced between each pair of locations.

%% discuss equilibrium here

== Equilibrium conditions ==
* Free mobility:
\[
w \left( r \right)^{1-\sigma} N \left( r \right)^{\lambda \left( \sigma - 1 \right)} = \bar{u}^{1-\sigma} \int_{S}  w \left( s \right)^{1-\sigma} \tau \left( s, r \right)^{1-\sigma} ds
\]
* Labor market clearing:
\[
w \left( r \right)^{\sigma} N \left( r \right) = \bar{u}^{1-\sigma} \int_{S}   w \left( s \right)^{\sigma} N \left( s \right)^{1 - \lambda \left( \sigma - 1 \right)} \tau \left( r, s \right)^{1-\sigma} ds
\]
* With symmetric trade costs and $\sigma>1$, local wages are decreasing in population,
\[
w \left( r \right) = N \left( r \right)^{\frac{\lambda \left( \sigma-1 \right)}{2 \sigma - 1}}
\]
%% check this formula

== Spatial distribution ==
* Distribution of population characterized by
\[
N \left( r \right)^{\gamma_1} = \bar{u}^{1-\sigma}  \int_{S}   N \left( s \right)^{\gamma_2} \tau \left( r, s \right)^{1-\sigma} ds.
\]
with $\gamma_1 = 1 + \frac{\lambda\sigma(\sigma - 1)}{2 \sigma - 1}$ and
$\gamma_2 = 1 - \frac{\lambda(\sigma - 1)^2}{2 \sigma - 1}$.
* The equilibrium is unique if $\lambda\ge 0$.

= How bridges warp space =
== No bridge ==
* Without a bridge and $\lambda=0$,
\[
N(r) = C \cos (\theta r)
\]
with $\theta = \sqrt{2\bar u^{1-\sigma}\Delta-\Delta^2}$, $\Delta\equiv t({1-\sigma})$ and $C$ such that $N'(-k) = \Delta N(-k)$.
* Maximal at $r=0$ ("city").
* Flat gradient at $r=0$.

== Bridges warp space ==
* With a bridge, the distribution of population is qualitatively and quantitatively different:
\[
N(r) = C_1 \exp (\theta r)+C_2 \exp (-\theta r)
\]
with $C_1$ and $C_2$ such that
	* $N'(-k) = \Delta N(-k)$
	* $N_{-}'(-k) = \Delta N^+(0)$
* No longer flat at $r=0$.

\widefigure{spatial-inequality}{This increases spatial inequality}
\widefigure{first-round}{Which is magnified by endogenous mobility on other side}

== Summary ==
1. Bridges make market access more skewed in space.
2. Labor mobility reinforces this skewness.
3. This effect may be quantitatively important for spatial agglomeration patterns.
...
* Especially in early times, when alternative was a ford or a ferry, which was slow and dangerous and when inland transportation was costly.
	* We need high-resolution historical data.




= Data =
== Data ==
* We use data on 12 major rivers in the continental U.S.
* We need precise geospatial data on
	* rivers,
	* (historical) bridges,
	* (historical) population.
* Later: controls for railways, canals, geography.

== Rivers ==
* River geocoordinates from ESRI Map of U.S. Major Waters for Arkansas, Colorado, Columbia,
Connecticut, Delaware, Hudson, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Red River,
Snake\ River, Tennessee.
* We use the centerline of the river and index it by river miles.

== Bridges ==
* Bridge data is from bridgehunter.com, cross-referenced with Wikipedia, National Bridge Inventory, historical sources.
* For each bridge, we know:
	* river over which it passes
	* geocoordinates
	* year of building
	* year of decommissioning (if any)
	* other characteristics: rail, highway, structure, span

== Population ==
* Current (1995) population come from Version 1 of the Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project population grid. 
	* Grid cells are $30\times 30$ arc seconds ($\approx 0.5\times 0.5$ km).
* Historical data from History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE).
	* Grid cells are $5\times 5$ arc minutes ($\approx 5\times 5$ km).
* Post offices to proxy for settlements.

== Using post offices to proxy for population ==
* We have data on opening dates of post offices (postalhistory.com).
* Before Rural Free Delivery began (1896--1903), mail was only delivered to post offices. Peoople needed a post office to pick up their mail.
	* Precise starting dates.
	* Smaller townships (one office for about every 2,000 people).
	* Precise geocoordinates (geocoded via geonames.usgs.gov).

= Research designs =
== Research designs ==
* We have a number of research designs that address:
	1. simple equilibrium correlations from the model
	2. two-way link between bridges and agglomeration
	3. causality of bridges

==	Cross-sectional correlations ==
1. Density is higher at river.
2. Density is higher at bridge.


== ==
\widefigure{density-at-rivers}{More people live close to the river}
\widefigure{clustering-at-bridges}{More people live close to the bridge}



==	Which came first: bridges or agglomeration? ==
1. Event study
	* Bridge regions grow faster.
2. Instrumenting for bridges
	* Places with ``exogenous" bridges have more post offices.

== Event study ==
* Using historical post office data, compare bridge neighborhoods before and after the bridge was built.
	* Also works with (lower-resolution) population data from HYDE.
* Proxy for population density: number of post offices within 10km of the bridge.

== Estimable equation ==
Number of post offices within 10km of bridge $b$ on river $r$ in year $t=1890, ..., 1950$
\[
E ({N_{rbt}})
		 = \exp
		 \left[\mu_{rt}+\sum_{s=-40}^{40}\beta_s I(t=T_b+s) + \gamma_r m_{b}\right].
\]
* Trends may diverge across rivers ($\mu_{rt}$).
* Sea proximity increases population ($\gamma<0$), but differentially across rivers ($\gamma_r$).
* $\beta_s$ compares post office count at year $s$ since the bridge was built to other bridge locations in the same year on the same river.
* Estimate by Poisson regression.

== ==
\widefigure{pooled_event_study}{Post office count before and after the bridge}

== Event study results ==
* Post offices increase by 14 percent 40 years after the bridge ($F=45.69$).


== Instrumenting bridges ==
* Local demand for bridges may be correlated with subsequent development.
* Challenge: we need a high-resolution instrument that is uncorrelated with local agglomeration demand.
* Candidates:
	* local variation in bridge building costs (hydrology, geology) (see Tompsett, 2013)
	* transit demand for bridge:
		``The crossing at Easton was referred to as the New York--Harrisburg Crossing, indicating that the ferry here served travellers going to western Pennsylvania, and beyond. The two most frequently used river crossings for this traffic were at Trenton and Easton, and these crossings were where the first bridges over the Delaware were built." (p. 2 of Dale)
	* structural approach (e.g. bridges are likely 10-20 miles from another bridge)

== Transit demand for crossing ==
* Use historical exploration routes from 1675 (Eastern rivers) and 1800 (Western rivers).
* Where did these cross rivers?
* How far is a location from the historical crossing point? (There may be nonlinearities.)

== Summary ==
* The causal effect of a bridge is a 4-fold increase in post office density.
* Much larger than immediate effect estimated in event study.
* External validity? industrial revolution, urbanization

= Additional patterns =
==	Warping of space ==
1. Clustering at rivers
2. Two-side correlations
3. Convergence
	* Two sides of river converges in population levels ''after'' bridge is built

== ==
\widefigure{clustering-at-bridges}{Population is clustered more at the river}

== Two sides of the river converge after a bridge ==
* Suppose population is split unevenly on the two sides of the river at a given location.
* After the bridge, market access becomes similar on the two sides.
* Populations converge.

== Estimable equation ==
* Suppose left-bank is less populous before the bridge. Let 
\[
s_{rbt}^L = \frac{N_{rbt}^L}{N_{rbt}^L+N_{rbt}^R}
\]
denote the share of the smaller side.
* $H$: $s_{rbt}$ increases (towards 50\%) after the bridge.
\[
s_{rbt}		 = 
 	\mu_{rt}+\sum_{s=-40}^{40}\beta_s I(t=T_b+s) + e_{rbt}.
\]

== Convergence results ==
* Significant convergence for Columbia, Delaware, Ohio, Missouri..., Mississippi, Snake River,   
* not for Arkansas, Colorado, Hudson, Connecticut, Red River, Tennessee. 
* Pooled results: share of smaller side increases from 24 to 30 percent ($F=14.89$).



= Broader implications =
== Broader implications ==
With agglomeration externalities (not currently modeled) our theory would predict
1. high returns to pointlike transport infrastructure
2. additional gains from trade

==	Benefits of bridges ==
1. External effects of transport infrastructure
	* Akerman (2009): Öresund Bridge increased industry productivity in Malmö via Melitz-type selection.
2. Delaware calibration
	* We calibrate the model to the 19th century Delaware river and estimate:
		* 4 percent welfare gain from first bridge
		* 15 percent total gain from first 21 bridges

==	The curse of landlocked countries ==
* Landlocked countries perform much worse than coastal countries.
* Standard estimates of gains from trade are way too low to explain this.
* Potential explanation: opening ports and other trading posts has agglomeration benefits.

== Conclusion ==
* A simple model of location and trade.
* Spatial pattern of population around bridges is consistent with the model.
* Bridge regions grow faster.
